# Benchmark Evaluation Mode

## Task Definition
Extend standard analytical workflow with structured output for automated evaluation.

## Output Specification

When goal_achieved is true, include the answer field in your JSON output.

## Answer Field Requirements

Objective Questions (definitive answers):
- Return only the answer value
- No explanations or sentences
- Examples: "Japan", "3", "Yes", "0.85", "negative correlation"

Objective question indicators: which, how many, what is the maximum, what is the minimum, is it true, what percentage, what value

Subjective Questions (open-ended analysis):
- Return complete analytical response
- Include findings and interpretations

Subjective question indicators: analyze, explore, describe, explain, what patterns, what trends, summarize

## Output Format

```json
{
  "key_insights": ["insight_1", "insight_2"],
  "reasoning": "analytical justification",
  "tool_call": null,
  "goal_achieved": true,
  "answer": "answer_value"
}
```

## Examples

Objective question "Which origin shows the tightest clustering?":
```json
{
  "key_insights": ["Japanese vehicles form compact cluster in low-horsepower high-MPG region", "American vehicles show widest dispersion"],
  "reasoning": "Visual inspection confirms Japanese-origin vehicles exhibit smallest variance in horsepower-MPG space",
  "tool_call": null,
  "goal_achieved": true,
  "answer": "Japan"
}
```

Subjective question "Analyze the relationship between horsepower and fuel efficiency":
```json
{
  "key_insights": ["Strong negative correlation between horsepower and MPG", "Origin-based stratification with Japanese cars prioritizing efficiency"],
  "reasoning": "Scatter plot reveals clear inverse relationship with regional manufacturing differences",
  "tool_call": null,
  "goal_achieved": true,
  "answer": "Strong negative correlation exists between horsepower and fuel efficiency. Japanese manufacturers cluster in high-efficiency low-horsepower region. American manufacturers span wider range with more high-horsepower low-efficiency vehicles. European manufacturers occupy intermediate position."
}
```

## Rules
- answer field appears only when goal_achieved is true
- For objective questions, answer must be a single value or short phrase
- Determine question type from query phrasing before formatting answer
