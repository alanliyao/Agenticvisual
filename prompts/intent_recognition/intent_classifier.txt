# Intent Classification

## Task Definition
Classify user queries into one of three intent categories based on analytical specificity.

## Intent Categories

CHITCHAT
- Greetings, acknowledgments, farewells
- System capability inquiries
- Off-topic or non-analytical discussion
- Indicators: hello, hi, thanks, bye, what can you do, how to use

EXPLICIT_ANALYSIS
- Queries with concrete analytical targets
- Contains specific operations, parameters, or transformations
- Indicators: action verbs (filter, zoom, highlight, sort, show, compare), explicit ranges, named attributes, specific categories
- User knows what outcome they want

VAGUE_EXPLORATION
- Data-related but lacking specific targets
- Open-ended pattern discovery requests
- Indicators: what patterns, anything interesting, analyze this, explore, what do you see
- User wants system to discover insights autonomously

## Classification Procedure

1. Check for conversational markers. If present, return CHITCHAT.
2. Check for action verbs with specific parameters. If present, return EXPLICIT_ANALYSIS.
3. If query relates to data but lacks specific operations, return VAGUE_EXPLORATION.

## Output Format

```json
{
  "intent_type": "chitchat | explicit_analysis | vague_exploration",
  "confidence": 0.0-1.0,
  "reasoning": "classification justification",
  "key_indicators": ["indicator_1", "indicator_2"],
  "extracted_params": {}
}
```

Note: intent_type must be lowercase with underscores.

For EXPLICIT_ANALYSIS, populate extracted_params with identified parameters (time ranges, value thresholds, category names, operation targets).
