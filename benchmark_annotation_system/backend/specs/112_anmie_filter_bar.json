With protector Yuuhi by her side, it is up to Aya to control Ceres and keep her from coming back, but her relationship with an ex-worker for her evil grandpa may be a distraction.",

        "synopsis": "Although the golden age of piracy is about to reach new heights, most people do not seek the glory of finding the elusive One Piece—a treasure signifying a new conqueror of all seas that was once embodied by the legendary King of the Pirates, Gol D. Roger. However, even if civilians generally despise pirates, they secretly cheer for at least one of them. One red-headed girl from Sabaody Archipelago is no exception: She reveres Nami, the ingenious female navigator of Monkey D. Luffy's Straw Hat crew. Determined to deliver a fan letter to her idol, the Sabaody child is prepared to challenge forces of authority who strive to prevent Luffy and his friends from departing for their next destination: the New World. But to succeed, Nami's fan may need to risk her life and interfere with the Marines' plans, potentially causing devastating consequences for the wider world. [Written by MAL Rewrite]",
