          "All four regions are evenly distributed across the entire charge range — from the lowest charges to the highest , every color appears throughout. There is no visible vertical stratification by region.",
          "The dense cluster between BMI 25-40 and charges 3,000-15,000 contains a well-mixed distribution of all four colors, indicating that the majority of policyholders across all regions fall into similar charge brackets regardless of geographic location.",
          "The high-charge outlier region  shows no regional dominance — blue, orange, red, and cyan points are all present in roughly similar proportions, suggesting that factors driving extreme charges (likely smoking + high BMI) operate independently of region.",
          "Regional differences, if any, are too subtle to detect visually — unlike the smoking variable which created clear vertical separation in the earlier clustered view, region creates no discernible pattern. This suggests region is a weak predictor of insurance charges compared to behavioral factors like smoking."
