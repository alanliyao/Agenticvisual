          "The zoomed view reveals at least two clear clusters among non-smokers (blue points) with charges below 15,000.",
          "The clusters are primarily separated by BMI, with the number of children (point size) acting as a secondary differentiator. This shows that even among non-smokers, these factors create distinct risk profiles reflected in insurance charges.",
          "The orange smoker points, while few, lie in the upper-left and do not overlap with the non-smoker clusters, reinforcing that smoking is a separate, high-impact factor.",
          "With smokers removed, the upward trend between BMI and charges becomes more visible",
          "Three distinct risk tiers are clearly defined",
          "Cluster 0 (Blue): Middle-risk group, with charges between 6,000–10,000 and BMI between 25–35. These points are mostly medium-sized, representing 1–2 children.",
          "Cluster 1 (Orange): High-risk group, with charges above 10,000 and BMI between 25–35. This aligns with the smoker subgroup, showing the strong impact of smoking on insurance costs.",
          "Cluster 2 (Green): Low-risk group, with charges below 6,000 and BMI between 20–30. These points are mostly small, representing 0–1 children.",
          "Cluster 1 (smokers) and Cluster 0 (non-smokers) have very similar BMI ranges, but their charges differ drastically. This confirms that smoking status is a more powerful predictor of insurance costs than BMI."
