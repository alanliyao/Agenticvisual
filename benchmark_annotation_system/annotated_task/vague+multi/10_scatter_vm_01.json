Regardless of whether their dietary habits are good, bad or average, the duration of their physical activities varies greatly. It can be seen that regardless of the quality of dietary habits, some people like to exercise while others don't. However, it can be observed that people with poor dietary habits are relatively less likely to engage in long-term exercise activities."
