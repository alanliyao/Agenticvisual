North America has a prominent share driven by the United States, while Europe, South America and other continents account for very few. The overall distribution shows a clear continental concentration, reflecting the imbalance and polarization of national employment levels worldwide."

          "Most countries in the original view are excluded from the top 10%, showing strong polarization in national employment scale.",
          "High-employment countries in the top 10% are mainly concentrated in North America and Asia, rather than being evenly spread across all continents.",
          "North America has a high proportion in this group, largely driven by the United States as a core outlier.",
          "Europe, South America and other continents have very few entries in the top 10% employment group.",
          "The distribution reflects that ultra-high national employment is a regional feature limited to major economic continents."
