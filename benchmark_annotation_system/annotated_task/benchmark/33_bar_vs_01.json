          "type": "open_ended",
          "value": "The ranking suggests a very steep dominance hierarchy. The list is extremely long. This structure implies that a very small number of top series account for the majority of total efficiency, while a vast long tail of series contributes minimally, indicating highly concentrated performance rather than balanced competition."

This transformed view directly answers the question about ranking structure. The extreme length of the list is clear evidence of a steep hierarchy with a dominant long tail. No further tools are needed for this high-level exploration."
