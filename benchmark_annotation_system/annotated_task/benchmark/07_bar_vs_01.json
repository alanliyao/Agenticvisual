            "reasoning": "The stacked bar chart made it difficult to compare sleep consistency within each diet quality group, so I switched to grouped mode to see individual weather categories side by side. By visually comparing the height variation of the four bars within each group, the average diet quality group clearly has the most uniform bar heights, while poor shows more pronounced differences between weather conditions. This suggests that people with good diet quality maintain more stable sleep patterns regardless of external weather factors."
