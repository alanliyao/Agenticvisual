          "In the South region, Electronics and Clothing contribute roughly equally to total sales. In contrast, Electronics dominates the West region's sales, accounting for over half of its total.",
          "he reorganized stacked layout makes it easier to spot that the West region relies more heavily on Electronics, while the South has a more balanced product mix.",

            "reasoning": "Changing the stack mode is a targeted action to transform how data is visually encoded. The original side-by-side bars required manual calculation to compare totals, but stacking combines the values into a single bar per region. This simplifies both the total sales comparison and the analysis of product contribution ratios. The goal was to quickly identify whether one region’s total was higher and to understand the product-level drivers behind that difference, which the stacked view achieves immediately. No further tools are needed as the key comparisons are now visually self-evident."
