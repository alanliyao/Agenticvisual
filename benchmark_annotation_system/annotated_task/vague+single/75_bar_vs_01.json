This helps uncover which continents have more countries, where outliers lie, and how employment clusters within regions—insights that were obscured by the original alphabetical order. Since the goal is to compare perceptual differences, this single action is sufficient to highlight how grouping changes interpretability, though further filtering could deepen the analysis."
