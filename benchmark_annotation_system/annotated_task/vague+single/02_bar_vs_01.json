            "reasoning": "Changing the encoding from bar height to color intensity is a single exploratory tool that shifts the focus from absolute value comparison to relative performance. This transformation is valuable because it reduces the cognitive load of comparing bar heights and instead uses pre-attentive visual cues (color) to highlight patterns. The goal is to uncover subtle performance differences that might be overlooked in the original bar chart, such as balanced vs. skewed product mixes across regions. This new view raises further questions about why certain region-product pairs perform better, which could be explored with additional tools like filtering or highlighting."
