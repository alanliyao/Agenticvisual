          "Vehicles with 3–4 cylinders (dark purple to light blue) dominate the high-MPG, low-horsepower region of the plot. This shows that fewer cylinders strongly correlate with better fuel efficiency.",
          "Vehicles with 8 cylinders (yellow) are clustered in the low-MPG, high-horsepower region, indicating a clear trade-off between raw power and fuel economy.",
          "The trend across all cylinder counts is consistent: as horsepower increases, MPG decreases. The color gradient (cylinders) confirms this is a fundamental relationship, not just a pattern for specific engine types.",
          "The color encoding makes it immediately clear that cylinder count is a powerful predictor of both horsepower and MPG. Vehicles with the same cylinder count cluster tightly together, highlighting the role of engine configuration in performance.",
          "After precise separation, the 8-cylinder vehicles exhibit distinct clustering characteristics: they are entirely concentrated in the high horsepower and low fuel consumption range, with minimal overlap with vehicles of other cylinder counts.",
          "The horsepower and fuel consumption of 8-cylinder vehicles exhibit a steeper negative correlation than the overall data set, with each increase in horsepower resulting in a more pronounced decrease in fuel consumption compared to the entire sample.",
          "The high density of cylinder-based vehicle clusters indicates that this model type exhibits a highly uniform performance orientation, with virtually no exceptions that balance high horsepower with high fuel consumption.",
          "The correlation coefficient for 8-cylinder vehicles is -0.527, indicating a moderately strong negative correlation. This is weaker than the global data's coefficient of -0.778.",
          "This finding indicates that in large-displacement vehicles such as 8-cylinder cars, the correlation between horsepower and fuel consumption is not as strong as in the overall sample. This may be because the design of such vehicles prioritizes power performance over efficiency.",
          "Comparing correlations across the entire dataset versus subsets reveals that the number of engine cylinders influences the strength of the relationship between horsepower and fuel consumption. This provides a quantitative basis for evaluating the performance-efficiency trade-offs across different vehicle models."

This step provides an accurate data foundation for subsequent correlation calculations, eliminating reliance on global trends. Next, the calculate correlation tool can be used to quantitatively validate the stronger negative correlation observed in 8-cylinder vehicles."
