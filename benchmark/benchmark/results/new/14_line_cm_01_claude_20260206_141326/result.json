      "answer": "Yes, there is a consistent underlying monthly visitor trend for Avila Adobe. The data shows a clear seasonal pattern that repeats annually, with summer months (June-August) consistently drawing peak visitors of 35,000-40,000, while winter months (December-February) show consistent lows around 15,000-20,000 visitors. This cyclical pattern persists throughout the entire 5-year period, though there is an overall declining trend in visitor numbers from 2016 onwards.",
