      "success": true,
      "answer": "Yes, there is a consistent underlying monthly visitor trend for Firehouse Museum. After excluding the extreme outlier in July 2014 (~62,000 visitors), the museum shows a stable baseline trend from 2015-2019 with visitor counts consistently ranging from 2,000-12,000. The trend exhibits modest seasonal variation with slightly higher peaks during summer months, but overall maintains relatively predictable monthly visitor levels without dramatic fluctuations.",
