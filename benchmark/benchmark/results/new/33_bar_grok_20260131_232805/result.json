From the get_data_summary tool, I obtained the count of entries per model, showing 3 Series with 2443, 1 Series with 1969, 2 Series with 1229, and others lower. The global mean mpg is about 56.4, so approximating sums based on counts suggests 3 Series has the highest sum (~137k), followed by 1 Series (~111k). However, average mpg may vary by model, so this is an estimate. The provided bar chart visually confirms high sums for models like 3 Series and 1 Series, but exact values are hard to read precisely from the image. The current view is a scatter plot, but the image shows a bar chart of sum mpg by model stacked by fuelType."
