The line exhibits clear periodic fluctuations with multiple peaks reaching around 35,000-42,000 visitors and valleys dipping to 20,000-25,000. These ups and downs repeat approximately yearly, suggesting a possible seasonal pattern (e.g., higher in summer months). However, after mid-2017, there is a noticeable overall downward trend, with visitor numbers declining to below 20,000 by 2018. This indicates that while there might be a consistent seasonal component, the long-term trend is not stable and shows decline."

However, the post-2017 decline to below 15,000 indicates the consistency is limited to the seasonal rhythm but not in magnitude over time. No new tool was needed as previous filtering and observations provide sufficient evidence to conclude the analysis."
