Looking at the scatter plot for Horsepower > 150, the lowest MPG value appears to be around 10, and the highest MPG value appears to be around 20. The highest point is slightly above 20, maybe 21 or 22, but the majority are below 20. The lowest point is clearly at 10. The highest point is a single outlier around 32.5, which I missed in the initial visual inspection. Let me re-examine the plot carefully for Horsepower > 150. There is one point around (150, 32.5). The rest of the points are concentrated between 10 and 20 MPG. Since the question asks for the 'approximate MPG range', I should include the minimum and maximum observed values in that region."
